# This is my take on the Action heroes task

**Tech stack:** React, React hooks, Typescript, Styled components, Ant design.

I don't have experience working with BE so I chose a very relevant mock api to work on.
Even though I also don't have many experiences setting up projects from scratch, I managed to pull through, while also keep in mind simplicity and eficiency with best practices that I remembered.
Overall I had great fun working on it and really happy to see what I have in mind comes to life.
